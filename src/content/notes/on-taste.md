Taste is the thing that makes you love what you love and hate what you hate, and you can't fully explain either. It's accumulated exposure plus something ineffable.

I used to think taste could be developed purely through exposure—see enough good things, and you'll know what good is. But I'm not sure anymore. Some people see great work their whole lives and still have terrible taste. Some people have sharp instincts from the start.

Maybe taste is less about what you've seen and more about how attentively you've seen it. The difference between consuming and actually noticing.

Still thinking about this.
