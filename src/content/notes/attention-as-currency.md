Everyone talks about attention as a resource that gets spent, but maybe it's more useful to think of it as a currency that gets exchanged. You give attention to get something—entertainment, information, connection, status.

The problem is that the exchange rates are hidden. You think you're getting entertainment when you scroll, but you're actually paying with something more valuable than the entertainment is worth. The platforms have figured out the rate better than we have.

I don't have a solution. I'm just trying to notice the exchanges more clearly.
