# My continuous list of objectives.

## MAIN
- Learn Japanese through watching Japanese shows/anime to a basic conversational level by May 2026 (i.e. I can go into Japanese VRchat worlds and interact)
- Host a VPS through Hetzner and managed with Dokploy; migrate L-file backend to use self-hosted server rather than Flyio
    - Create a Team Ninjaruss Fluxer server
- Migrate most of my accounts/tech use to more privacy-oriented solutions or more flexible options; i.e. Gmail -> Proton Mail?, already using 1Password, 

## SIDE
- Edit and publish Tokyo June 2025 vlog Part 2
- Catch up to the latest chapter of One Piece
- Write more blurbs for the Favorites section in ninjaruss.net
- Create Scrivner plugin to export data to my website (show my work publicly)?

## LIVESTREAM
- I reviewed my Internet account history. (deleting old accounts and resetting passwords found on my 1Password)
- Properly setting up a VPS (Hetzner + Dokploy)?
- L-file Research (contribute to L-file database)
- VRChat Quests (search for other weebs, use words I've learned, etc)
