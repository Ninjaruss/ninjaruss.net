There's a bias toward completion that I'm trying to unlearn. The assumption that something isn't real until it's done. But most of my best thinking happens in the middle, before the pressure to wrap things up kicks in.

Maybe the problem is that finishing something requires committing to what it is, and commitment means closing doors. The unfinished thing can still be anything.

Or maybe I'm just rationalizing my inability to ship.

Both things can be true.
