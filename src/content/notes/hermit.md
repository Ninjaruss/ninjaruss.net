## I am a lowkey hermit. At least, in terms of my social relationships.

I was wondering why I've become a sort of recluse where I'll disappear for months at a time before interacting with my friends in person. It's less obvious now since as an adult it's difficult to always make time to see every friend group you have, but I think there's a history that might show why I tend to go off and do my own thing.

My current theory is due to my location and the schools I went to. My parents wanted the best for me when it comes to education. Not to an extreme extent, but enough to really want to avoid any "ghetto" schools. Keep in mind, I've lived in what you could call a sketchy neighborhood where theft and burgularies have often occured around the area. In fact, a few occurrences have happened to me where people have broken into my family's house and stolen TVs as well as cars. So perhaps my parents' caution was valid, even if it was a little bit much at times. 

As a result, I would have to take the bus and the train to reach better schools starting from middle school onwards. This would make it difficult for me to fit in and spend more time with friends as I would always needed to head back home after school. Partly due to my parent's work schedules and party cause I wanted to play online games like Roblox in my spare time.

I don't necessarily mind this aloof perception of my social life, but I have now reached a point where I realize I was lacking a tight knit community that would help me reach my goals. That's not to say I had no friend groups or clubs I did eventually join, but for the most part, they were merely aligned with my interests rather than my inner goals.

I really want to write a cool story. I really want to become an outstanding individual. I want to do something different than the norm. In order to do that, I sort of need to go towards my own path. Unfortunately, just like my experience with being a hermit, I will be mostly alone in following towards my aligned goals.

Despite this required sacrifice, I don't plan to do this completely alone. I understand the importance of having a community, so I will do my best to be open with how I approach my own path. Instead of continuing my perception of being a hermit, I will break that idea and turn it into something unimaginable.
