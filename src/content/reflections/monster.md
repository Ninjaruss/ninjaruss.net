There's something about how slowly this show moves that makes it feel like dread. Not horror dread—the dread of watching someone make choices they can't take back, and knowing you'd probably make the same ones.

Tenma's arc isn't about heroism. It's about what happens when your principles get tested by reality, and you realize the gap between who you thought you were and who you actually are.

I keep thinking about the thesis: can anyone be redeemed? The show doesn't answer it cleanly, which is the point.
