Made in 1997, still the most accurate depiction of what the internet does to identity. Satoshi Kon understood something about performance and self that we're only now catching up to.

The thing I keep coming back to: the film doesn't moralize. It just shows you what happens when the boundary between your performed self and your real self starts to dissolve. It's not interested in telling you that's bad—it just shows you why it's terrifying.

I think about this movie every time I see someone's carefully curated online presence crack.
