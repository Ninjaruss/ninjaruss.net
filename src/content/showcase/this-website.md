This is my (3rd?) attempt at making a personal website. I've tried making one in the past multiple times, but they all usually end up clunky or I lose the motivation to work on it. This time though? I have the power of AI on my side!

Jokes aside, I built this site on a whim as I was really disappointed at the old ninjaruss.net I made more than a year ago. That site was previously built with WordPress and hosted on Hostinger's discounted plan. I didn't know at the time, but I realized that the Hostinger plan I was on kind of sucks if you ever want to attempt making your own website without the bloat from WordPress and stuff. 

What's funny is, I have a full on 4-year degree in Computer Science and I ended up settling for Wordpress... which was due to my idea that it was easier to edit/save content through the posts content management system. I honestly could have coded the site from scratch, but back then, I really didn't like frontend design. Mainly due to how JavaScript works and my perception that TypeScript was overcomplicating things (I tried working with it but it caused more issues since I wasn't really understanding how to work in that language).

But we live in the 21st century and it is the big 2026! Large language models (LLM) like ChatGPT and Google Gemini now just spit out code in a blink of an eye... except it is an absolute mess for someone like me who isn't a LeetCode obssessed mastermind. After my experience with [building a Usogui archive website](/showcase/l-file), I am a bit more aware of the pitfalls and effectiveness of mainly Claude Code (and some OpenAI Codex). 

Agentic coding, where you can have the LLM directly edit your project files, is a bit of an addiction of mine. The workflow of trying to identify issues, sending them to the LLM with any additional context I can muster with my vibe code rotted brain, and waiting for the agent to finish is something I've gotten comfortable with. Mind you, I clearly need to learn more on more effective workflows like integrating more Model Context Protocols (MCP) and taking advantage of setting clear constraints.

As of writing this, Claude Code has tightened the limits on usage noticeably. I am on the Pro plan, but within like 3 days of active (vibe) coding, I can hit the weekly limit. However, even with the new limits, I can make a website like this in nearly under two days. Granted, this is a static site that doens't have many moving parts, but it's amazing how many things I can add and adjust with the help of vibe coding. 

If you'd like to see the technical parts of the site (even though it isn't relatively complicated architecture-wise), you can find it [here](https://github.com/Ninjaruss/ninjaruss.net). It's using Astro and being hosted on Cloudflare Pages. Feel free to copy as you see fit. Just make sure to write your own thoughts without the LLM telling you what to do!

With the coding out of the way, the real issue is content... and so far I think I've hit a good psychological stage in my life to actually make write more stuff for this website. I am letting go of the idea that "this site is pointless" and treating it more as an opportunity to express myself as well as log my thoughts. I've done this in the past, but feel more driven now. Maybe it's cause I have a lot more things to make this process easier (Claude Code, Macbook Air M4, understanding this should be treated as a mind dump rather than a structured blog that "needs" content). We'll let time decide. I have a feeling this will be a beautiful piece of work for whoever wants to know what I'm up to.

Oh no, I've turned into a text yapper... if you read up to this point you are an absolute OG.
