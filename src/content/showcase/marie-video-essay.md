I really liked Marie's character from Persona 4 Golden so much that I made a whole video essay on her. Not only that, I went out of my way to express myself through her character. [Why is that?](/media/marie)

In creating this video, there were multiple things that really made this a truly special video for me. 
- I was really struggling with getting out of my mind as I felt I wasn't making much out of myself (even though I've been doing great compared to my peers). The act of recording the sections for this video helped me a lot in letting go of any perfectionistic or doubt driven thoughts.
- I found out that Eden Riegel, the English Voice Actress for Marie, was going to be in Los Angeles for a meet and greet; I made the effort to show up and have a lovely conversation with her.

- To not be too forgettable and to try my hand at a little bit of art, I made a poem expressing my thoughts and feelings in life.

Admittedly, this is a little bit of a cringy video when viewed in the lens I did all this effort for a fictional character I relate to. But really, I am proud I spent the effort and pushed through the friction to complete this project. I now have a piece of work that although may not be super polished and impactful, it has given me an unforgettable set of experiences and memories I will take with me into my next endeavor. 

Maybe I'll record that Usogui video essay I wanted to make...
I already have a good amount of the script done for it, but I felt like I needed to reevaluate its focus. This is a bit of a cop out excuse as if you know me, I tend to start projects and will let things slowly freeze up until I don't end up finishing it.
