## Ninjaruss origins go far deep, so far so that I had my own ninja roleplay group.
For someone with ninja embedded in their username, this shouldn't be a surprise right? Well, the makings of this group was so weird and contained that even I'm surprised how this came about. Fuma-shi is a roleplay group centered around ninjas in a fictional village. We would host trainings every week on the ways to apply ninja ideas to Roblox. Stuff like techniques to use in sword fighting, general combat, and espionage. However, it actually goes further back to something less related to Japanese roleplay.

Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 by Friaza. This, I dare say, was one of the greatest fighting games that Roblox ever had. Being able to play as your favorite character like Kakashi and taking part in fights that required good spacing, decent reaction time, and comfortablity with the movement controls was a peak experience. I really liked that game that I eventually stumbled upon a group for the game called Karuso. We would basically do small tournaments and get improve on our use of the mechanics.

Luckily, the above video is one of the very few I can find that shows the vibe of the game. 

How does this eventually turn into a Japanese roleplay group? Well, as an extension of Naruto, we were naturally interested in trying to play Naruto related games. Everything is pretty fuzzy, but I remember finding a small roleplay group that was showcasing itself to be a more grounded form of Konohoagakure. The group is defunct and the owner for it moved onto playing Star Wars roleplay stuff, but the group's remains still exist on the Internet.

This was where the idea of a ninja roleplay group started to take form in my head. They would host trainings and teach while having their very own Hidden Leaf village to use. The concept of a raidable base, where the goal of outsiders is to raid and win a skirmish against a group's base was super cool. Having like a full server of people using their tactics and whatever tools given in the game was something I wanted to replicate myself.

There's a whole history that I could attempt to parse through, but here are a few highlights:
- Was originally Uzushiogakure before major overhaul in 2016

- Takeda clan vs Fuma-shi

- Shogunate taken over by Taira makes way for Fuma-shi to be an independent clan

Admittedtly, I was primarily a facilitator for developing the group's places and formatting the overall structure. Especially after 2016 was when I became more of a backend manager rather than an active participant. The clan was thriving by how genuine everyone was by having fun with what we made here. Having trainings nearly every week with reports on what was done and even implementing formation commands made the experience immersive. I gotta say, in hindsight, this was a beautiful experience that I cherish even though it was for a very niche space on Roblox.

If I really wanted to, I could probably continue on this legacy by playing something like Nin Online (which I did for a good bit of time), but it would be hard to replicate the simplicity of what was done during the era of Fuma-shi. The key thing I'm learning from this was how important it is to try making a community and connect with other people. Even if it is something as obscure as Fuma-shi or even now weebcloset, the social connection really helped with my understanding of how to communicate with different types of people and that it all starts with you.
