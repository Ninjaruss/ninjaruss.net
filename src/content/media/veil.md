I'm going to be honest, there really isn't a singular thing that I can point to that describes why this is my favorite song of all time so far. Most who know me would guess the opening for Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann - Sorairo Days would be my number one. Yet, I still listen to this song more often than any song I have on my playlist. It's not even for an anime that I really like as it's the first ending theme for Fire Force. 

To me, the biggest factor might be the flow to how this song goes. It has all of the hallmarks of a great Japanese banger: lowkey start into a fire intro, catchy chorus, and smooth transitions. 

(going to be honest, I don't have better words to describe the music cause I haven't paid much attention to instrumental stuff; if the song sounds good its good lol)

What I am trying to say is, there's a dynamic between high points and low points combined that I love. The song's lyrics further this vibe I am describing by actually being bittersweet/sad while the music is upbeat. Racing Into the Night by YOASOBI hits the same energy as this song. 

I made a video looking into the lyrics to this song and found myself resonating in an odd way to the song.
