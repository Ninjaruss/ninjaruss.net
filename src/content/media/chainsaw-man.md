I don't know if Fujimoto is a genius or just someone who throws things at a wall until they stick. Maybe both. The tonal whiplash is the point, but I still don't know how I feel about it.

The moments that hit—Aki and the snowball fight, anything with Power—hit because they feel unearned. Like the story isn't supposed to care about these people, but it does anyway.

Still processing the ending. Still not sure if the themes hold together or if I'm projecting coherence onto chaos.
