Usogui is one of my favorite manga. It's also nearly impossible to recommend because it's dense, untranslated for years, and requires significant context to appreciate.

The project started as personal documentation—notes on the gambling strategies, character relationships, translation comparisons. Then it became something other people found useful.

I'm still figuring out how much time I want to put into this. It's deeply satisfying work, but it's also a lot of effort for a niche audience.

Maybe that's okay. Not everything needs to scale.
