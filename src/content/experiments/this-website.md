I've tried to build personal sites before. They always ended up feeling like portfolios or resumes—things designed to impress rather than express.

This time I wanted something different. A place for fragments. Notes on things I've consumed, half-formed thoughts, projects framed as experiments rather than accomplishments.

The Persona 4 Golden inspiration came from wanting something that felt energetic and structured but not corporate. The gold accents and bold typography are an attempt at having a visual identity without it feeling like branding.

Still iterating. Still not sure it works.
