I'm back to having a little too many main objectives at once, but this time with better focus on what truly matters to me. I truly believe that I have what it takes to fully actualize myself and at this point it is to continue dismantling any barriers stopping me.

Unfortunately, it requires me to go through a lot of emotional conflict from my parents and my own old identity trying to keep me in stasis.

I want to try living in Japan. It seems that so many things I enjoy are from there and I want to figure out the core reason why. The difficulty to pursue this seems very high, but my mindset has developed over the past few years to where I am accepting that it takes commitment and drive to make anything happen.

In the mean time while I keep progressing towards that goal, I am doing my best to focus on building stuff I find meaningful or plainly enjoyable. Playing around with vibe coding to make this site and the Usogui archive has been a lot of fun recently.

To end things off, I want to let myself know that I need to follow where my core being leads me and to slowly remove the habits that don't help me become who I want to be.
